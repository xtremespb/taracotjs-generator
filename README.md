### Pre-requisites

Download and install Node.js for your operating system: http://nodejs.org/download/. Node Package Manager (npm) should be installed by default; if not, please take care of it's installation.

MongoDB and Redis are required. If your operating system is x64-based Windows, you may download the pre-compiled MongoDB and Redis here: https://taracot.org/source/db/mongo_redis_win64.zip. Unzip the files included to any folder on your hard disk and start using start.cmd. Two minimized console applications will be started, they should remain open every time you run TaracotJS server. For Linux/UNIX and MacOS-based operating systems you may install the corresponding MongoDB and Redis packages manually or compile from sources.

### Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with TaracotJS is to utilize the executable taracotjs to generate an application as shown below.

Install taracotjs-generator:

  ```npm install -g taracotjs-generator```

Create Taracot JS instance:

  ```taracotjs /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo```

Install dependencies:

  ```npm install```

Edit config.js (using your favorite text editor), don't forget to set MongoDB connection URL and Redis port. You don't have to edit secrets and salt at this point, they will be auto-generated on the next step.

Perform system post-configuration:

  ```cd bin && node install-system && node install-modules```

Rock and Roll:

  ```node webserver```

If everything goes well, you will see the following message: “TaracotJS server listening on port: 3000” (3000 is the default port). Open up your favorite browser and open the following page: http://127.0.0.1:3000/.
